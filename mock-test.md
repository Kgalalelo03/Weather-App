### ReactJS Class Test: Practical Exercise

#### Instructions:
1. This test consists of a practical coding exercise.
2. Read the instructions carefully before coding.
3. Write your code in the provided space.
4. You have 90 minutes to complete the exercise.

#### Practical Exercise:
You are tasked with creating a React component called `WeatherWidget` that fetches weather data from an API and displays it. Use `useState` to manage the weather data state and `useEffect` to fetch the data when the component mounts.

#### Detailed Requirements:
1. **API Endpoint**: Fetch weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API. You can sign up for a free API key on their website: [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/).
2. **City Input**: The `WeatherWidget` component should accept a `city` prop indicating the name of the city for which weather data should be fetched.
3. **Display Data**: Display the following weather information:
   - City name
   - Temperature (in Celsius)
   - Weather description
4. **Error Handling**: Handle errors gracefully. If the API request fails, display an error message indicating the failure.
5. **Styling**: Style the component to make it visually appealing. You can use CSS or a CSS framework like Bootstrap.

#### Submission:
Submit your completed `WeatherWidget` component code within the provided space. Ensure that your code meets all the requirements outlined above.
